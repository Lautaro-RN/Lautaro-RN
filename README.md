- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lautaro-RN. I'm a Backend Web Developer, with some basic knowledge of FrontEnd - AKA my projects do work fine but sometimes don't look pretty! 😝
- 👀 I’m interested in Science, History, Geography, music, sports and tech - quite curious.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics and OOP for Python. Next year I would like to study some PHP Frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Base or Web Developing projects. Multiplatform systems (Web - Native in Windows - Android) would be fun to.
- 📫 How to reach me: My LinkedIn -> https://www.linkedin.com/in/lautaro-franco-rn/ ; soon my portfolio page will be ready. Working on... 🛠️👷‍♂️
